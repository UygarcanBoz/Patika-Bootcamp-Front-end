    <h1>Diversity of the World: Animal Kingdom</h1>
    <p>There are millions of different species of animals on Earth, exhibiting a great diversity among them. These animals, each with unique characteristics, have adapted to different habitats. Animals living in terrestrial, aquatic, and aerial environments have developed various adaptations throughout the process of evolution. This diversity not only contributes to the balance of ecosystems but also emphasizes the importance of preserving biodiversity. Moreover, each animal species interacts with others in the ecosystem, ensuring the harmonious functioning of nature. Therefore, the diversity of animal species is not only about presenting the beauty of nature but also crucial for the sustainability of ecosystems.</p>
